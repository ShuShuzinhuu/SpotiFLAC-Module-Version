---

## Installation

```bash
pip install SpotiFLAC

```

---

## Quick Start

Import the module and start downloading immediately:

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

# Simple Download
SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT",
    output_dir="./downloads"
)
```
New use:
```spotiflac 
> spotiflac url ./out --service tidal spoti --use-artist-subfolders
```
---

## Advanced Configuration

You can customize the download behavior, prioritize specific streaming services, and organize your files automatically into folders.

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/album/41MnTivkwTO3UUJ8DrqEJJ",
    output_dir="./MusicLibrary",
    services=["qobuz", "amazon", "tidal", "youtube"],
    filename_format="{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}",
    use_artist_subfolders=True,
    use_album_subfolders=True,
    loop=60 # Retry duration in minutes
)
```


## Qobuz Token (Optional)

Setting a personal Qobuz token improves metadata resolution reliability. The token is used as a **last resort fallback** — requests are first attempted anonymously, and only if they fail (HTTP 400/401) the token is injected. A **free Qobuz account** is sufficient.

> **Important:** Use throwaway credentials (random email + password you won't forget). You'll need them again if the token expires and needs to be regenerated.

### How to Create a Free Account

Go to [qobuz.com](https://www.qobuz.com) and register. No payment method required for the free tier.

### How to Extract Your Token

1. Log in to [play.qobuz.com](https://play.qobuz.com)
2. Open DevTools with **F12** → go to the **Network** tab
3. Play any track or perform any search to trigger API calls
4. Filter requests by typing `api.json` in the search bar
5. Click on any request to `www.qobuz.com/api.json/...`
6. In the **Request Headers** panel, look for: **x-user-auth-token: your_token_here**
7. Copy the value — that is your token

---

## Spotify Token (sp_dc) for Synced Lyrics (Optional)
Spotify requires a session cookie called sp_dc to access its internal synced lyrics API.

### How to Extract Your Token
1. Open your web browser and go to open.spotify.com
2. Log in to your Spotify account.
3. Open DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I).
4. Navigate to the Application tab (or "Storage" in Firefox).
5. On the left sidebar, expand Cookies and select https://open.spotify.com.
6. Search for the row named sp_dc.
7. Double-click its Value, copy it, and keep it safe. (Do not share this token!)

## Musixmatch Token (usertoken) for Rich-Synced Lyrics (Optional)
Musixmatch offers highly accurate word-level synchronized lyrics. To use it, you need a user token from their desktop app.

### How to Extrack Your Token
1. Download and install the official Musixmatch Desktop App (Windows/Mac).
2. Log in to your account.
3. Open DevTools inside the app (usually Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows or Cmd+Option+I on Mac).
4. Go to **Network**  tab.
5. Play a song or view lyrics in the app to generate network traffic.
6. Look at the requests being made and inspect their Headers or Payload.
7. Find the usertoken parameter and copy its alphanumeric value.

## How to Apply Tokens in SpotiFLAC
Once you have your Spotify or Musixmatch tokens, you can pass them to SpotiFLAC in several ways:

### Environment Variable (all platforms)

The recommended approach across all systems:

```bash
export QOBUZ_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
export SPOTIFY_TOKEN="YOUR_SP_DC_COOKIE"
export MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN="YOUR_USERTOKEN"
```
### On Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
set QOBUZ_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
set SPOTIFY_TOKEN="YOUR_SP_DC_COOKIE"
set MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN="YOUR_USERTOKEN"
```
### On Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
$env:QOBUZ_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
$env:SPOTIFY_TOKEN="YOUR_SP_DC_COOKIE"
$env:MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN="YOUR_USERTOKEN"
```
> To make it permanent on Linux/macOS, add the export line to your **~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc**, or equivalent shell config file.


### .env file (Environment Variables)

If you prefer using a local configuration file for environment variables (highly recommended for development or Docker), you can create a file named .env in the root folder of your project:
```env
QOBUZ_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_QOBUZ_TOKEN
SPOTIFY_TOKEN=YOUR_SP_DC_COOKIE
MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN=YOUR_USERTOKEN
```

You can load this file before running the script from the terminal:
```bash
export $(cat .env | xargs) && python launcher.py "URL" ./downloads --embed-lyrics
```

Or, if you use Docker Compose, you can easily integrate it:
```yaml
services:
  spotiflac:
    env_file:
      - .env
```
> Add **.env** to your **.gitignore** to avoid accidentally committing your token.
### CLI (Terminal)
```bash
python launcher.py "URL" ./downloads \
    --embed-lyrics \
    --qobuz-auth-token "YOUR_QOBUZ_TOKEN" \
    --spotify-token "YOUR_SP_DC_COOKIE" \
    --musixmatch-token "YOUR_MUSIXMATCH_USERTOKEN" \
```

### Python
```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="URL",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    embed_lyrics=True,
    qobuz-auth-token="YOUR_QOBUZ_TOKEN" \
    lyrics_spotify_token="YOUR_SP_DC_COOKIE",
    lyrics_musixmatch_token="YOUR_MUSIXMATCH_USERTOKEN",
)
```

### config.json
```json
{
    "qobuz_token": "IL_TUO_TOKEN_QOBUZ",
    "spotify_token": "IL_TUO_COOKIE_SP_DC",
    "musixmatch_token": "IL_TUO_USERTOKEN",
    "embed_lyrics": true
}
```
